# GymActivity v1
This is an activity tracker for the gym, allows you to keep track of your workout cards. Selecting one, the app starts the Training menu in keeps track of sets and reps and rest time. Useful for keeping track of workout history and as a training aid.
The idea in future is to add a comunication with APPLE WATCH for add some monitoring fetures and also to make the app more convenient and easy to use.
The app is still in development,need better UI
